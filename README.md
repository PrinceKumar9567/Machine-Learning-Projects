# Machine-Learning-Projects
📌 Machine Learning Project
📖 Overview

  This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the price of a product/asset (e.g., Gold, Cars, Houses, etc.) based on various influential        features.
  The goal of this project is to build a reliable regression model that can estimate price values using historical or real-world data.

🧠 Problem Statement

  Develop a supervised learning model that:
  
  Learns the relationship between features and price
  
  Predicts future prices accurately
  
  Helps in decision-making or market insights

🚀 Features

Data Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Selection / Engineering

Multiple ML Models evaluated

Model Performance Metrics reported

Visualization dashboards/plots included

Deployment ready code structure
